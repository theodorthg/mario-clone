extends Control

## Drawn on its own Control, sitting right on top of hud.gd's MuteButton in
## the tree (see hud.gd::_add_mute_glass()) — NOT drawn as part of the HUD
## parent's own _draw() like a first attempt did, because a Button's own
## StyleBoxFlat background draws AFTER (on top of) whatever its parent drew,
## so an icon painted by the parent sits BEHIND the button and gets
## partially or fully hidden depending on the button's current hover/pressed
## alpha (confirmed live: visible at rest, invisible once hovered/pressed).
## A separate Control positioned after the button in the tree draws on top
## of it instead, with mouse_filter=IGNORE so clicks still reach the button
## underneath.

## Same vector speaker-cone icon as originally sketched — see hud.gd's
## former _draw_mute_icon() history for why it's hand-drawn rather than a
## font glyph. Sound-wave arcs when unmuted, a diagonal cross when muted.
